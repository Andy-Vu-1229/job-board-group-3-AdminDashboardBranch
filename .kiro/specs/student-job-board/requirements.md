# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Student Job Board is a comprehensive web application designed for a capstone project that connects students with job opportunities posted by faculty, staff, board members, and company representatives. The platform features multi-role user management (Student, Faculty/Staff, Company Representative, Admin), job posting and approval workflows, comprehensive job posting requirements, and automated archiving of expired jobs. This initial phase focuses on building the frontend foundation with React, establishing core navigation, authentication UI, and the main job browsing interface that will support the full feature set.
