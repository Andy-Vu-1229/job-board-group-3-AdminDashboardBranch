# Design Document

## Overview

The Student Job Board is a React-based web application built on AWS Amplify that serves multiple user roles with distinct interfaces and capabilities. The design leverages modern React patterns, TypeScript for type safety, and AWS Amplify for authentication and data management. The architecture supports role-based access control, comprehensive job posting workflows, and scalable component organization.

The application follows a mobile-first, accessible design approach with clean, professional styling that reflects the academic environment while maintaining ease of use for all user types.

    E --> K[Admin Dashboard]
    
    F --> L[Job CRUD Operations]
    F --> M[Approval Workflow]
    F --> N[Auto-Archiving]
```

### Component Architecture

The application follows a hierarchical component structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **App Level**: Authentication, routing, and global state management
- **Layout Level**: Navigation, headers, and role-based UI shells
- **Page Level**: Dashboard views for each user role
- **Feature Level**: Job posting, job browsing, user management components
- **UI Level**: Reusable form elements, cards, buttons, and utility components

### Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: User signs in → AWS Amplify Auth → Role determination → Route to appropriate dashboard
2. **Job Posting Flow**: Create/Edit → Validation → Approval (if required) → Publish → Auto-archive on deadline
3. **Job Browsing Flow**: Fetch active jobs → Apply filters → Display results → Handle interactions
4. **Admin Flow**: Manage users → Oversee postings → Review analytics → Maintain platform

}

interface ContactMethod {
  type: 'email' | 'careers_page' | 'phone';
  value: string;
  instructions?: string;
}
```

### API Interfaces

#### Job Management API
- `getActiveJobs()`: Retrieve all active job postings
- `getJobById(id)`: Get detailed job information
- `createJob(jobData)`: Create new job posting
- `updateJob(id, jobData)`: Update existing job posting
- `deleteJob(id)`: Remove job posting
- `approveJob(id)`: Approve pending job posting
- `archiveJob(id)`: Manually archive job posting

#### User Management API
- `getCurrentUser()`: Get current user information
- `updateUserRole(userId, role)`: Admin function to change user roles
- `getUsersByRole(role)`: Get users by specific role
- `trackJobView(jobId)`: Record job view for analytics

## Data Models

### Database Schema

The application uses AWS Amplify DataStore with the following models:

#### User Model
- Stores user authentication and profile information
- Links to AWS Cognito for authentication
- Includes role-based permissions and department/company affiliations

#### JobPosting Model
- Comprehensive job posting information
- Includes approval workflow status
- Supports automatic archiving based on deadline
- Tracks engagement metrics

#### Application Model (Future Enhancement)
- Links students to job postings
- Tracks application status and communication
- Supports internal messaging system

### Data Relationships

```mermaid
erDiagram
    User ||--o{ JobPosting : creates
    User ||--o{ JobPosting : approves
    JobPosting ||--o{ Application : receives
    User ||--o{ Application : submits
    User ||--o{ SavedJob : bookmarks
    JobPosting ||--o{ SavedJob : saved_as
```

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

1. **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials, expired sessions, unauthorized access
2. **Validation Errors**: Form validation, required field errors, format validation
3. **Network Errors**: API failures, connectivity issues, timeout errors
4. **Permission Errors**: Role-based access violations, insufficient permissions
5. **Data Errors**: Missing records, data corruption, constraint violations

### Error Handling Strategy

- **Global Error Boundary**: Catches and displays unexpected errors
- **Form Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **API Error Handling**: Consistent error response handling with user-friendly messages
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry for transient network errors
- **Fallback UI**: Graceful degradation when features are unavailable

### Error Display Patterns

- **Inline Errors**: Form field validation errors
- **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages for actions
- **Error Pages**: Full-page errors for critical failures
- **Loading States**: Clear indication of processing states
